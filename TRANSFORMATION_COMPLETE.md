# ✨ OmniForge Transformation Complete

## 🎉 Successfully Transformed to Suno-Style Platform!

**Date:** 2025-11-15  
**Status:** ✅ **PRODUCTION READY & SUNO-ALIGNED**

---

## 🎯 What Was Accomplished

OmniForge Studio has been fully transformed from a traditional multi-tool interface into a **single-prompt production platform** inspired by Suno.ai.

### Core Philosophy
> **"One Prompt. Complete Production."**

Just like Suno creates complete songs from a single prompt, OmniForge now creates complete multi-modal productions (text + images + audio + more) from one simple input.
